We don’t need to be on your own
She walks alone in shame in pain
She closes her eyes one more day in the hell

Tears fall down her face
As they break her down she surrenders
She disappears inside
As she cries for her savior

We are all under the sun
Under the samy sky so,
Why do I feel all alone?
Under the sun, under the same sky
We don’t need to be
On our own, on our own

He walks alone pretends to feel
Useless hope so numb so unreal
He disappears inside you’re not alone
In being alone
